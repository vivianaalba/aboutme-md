#**Viviana Alba**

##**Background**

During my undergraduate studies, I hoped to become a doctor and majored in biology. However, after graduating and working in clinical research, I realized that I really enjoyed the technical side of research. I consider myself a very introverted and creative person and felt like the career path of a doctor no longer suited me. I decided to change careers and am now learning web development through The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship.I hope to merge the fields of biology and technology to bring more sense and understanding into the world.
